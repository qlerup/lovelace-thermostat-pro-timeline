# Thermostat Timeline Card

A Lovelace card for Home Assistant that lets you plan temperatures on a simple, draggable timeline and (optionally) auto-apply the setpoint to your `climate.*` entities.

> **Custom element:** `thermostat-timeline-card`  
> **File (served by HACS):** `thermostat-pro-timeline.js`

## Features
- Per-thermostat timeline with blocks (from–to, °C)
- Default temperature per row
- Double‑click/double‑tap to edit blocks
- “Now” indicator on the timeline
- Optional auto‑apply of setpoint via `climate.set_temperature`
- Lovelace GUI editor

## Installation (HACS – as a custom repository)
1. Upload/publish this to GitHub as `lovelace-thermostat-pro-timeline` (or any name you prefer).
2. In Home Assistant → **HACS** → ⋯ → **Custom repositories** → add your GitHub URL, **Category: Dashboard**.
3. Find and install the card in HACS. In recent HA versions, the resource is added automatically.  
   Typical resource URL:  
   `/hacsfiles/lovelace-thermostat-pro-timeline/thermostat-pro-timeline.js`

### Manual installation
1. Copy `thermostat-pro-timeline.js` to `/config/www/`.
2. Add the resource in **Settings → Dashboards → Resources**:
   - URL: `/local/thermostat-pro-timeline.js`
   - Type: **JavaScript Module**

## Usage
Add a card to your dashboard with YAML:

```yaml
type: custom:thermostat-timeline-card
title: Thermostat Timeline
entities:
  - climate.living_room
  - climate.bedroom
storage_entity: sensor.thermostat_timeline   # optional (see “Storage & sync”)
default_temp: 20
row_height: 64
now_update_ms: 60000
show_top_now: false
now_extend_px: 76
auto_apply: true
apply_on_edit: true
apply_on_default_change: true
labels:
  climate.living_room: Living room
  climate.bedroom: Bedroom
```

### Options (excerpt)
- `entities` (**required**): List of `climate.*` entities.
- `title`: Card title.
- `default_temp` (°C): Default temperature per row.
- `row_height` (px): Row height.
- `now_update_ms`: Refresh interval for the “now” indicator.
- `storage_entity` (e.g. `sensor.thermostat_timeline`): If present, the schedule is synced via a sensor attribute through a service call (see below). Otherwise browser LocalStorage is used.
- `auto_apply`: Automatically set the setpoint on the given `climate.*` entities to match the active block.
- `apply_on_edit`: Apply immediately if an edit changes the current setpoint.
- `apply_on_default_change`: Apply immediately if changing “Default °C” affects the current setpoint.
- `labels`: Optional map from `entity_id` → display name in the UI.

## Storage & sync
- **With integration (`thermostat-pro-timeline-sync`)**: To keep the dashboard in sync across browsers/devices, use my companion integration which exposes a sensor and a service to persist the schedule.  
  → Integration: https://github.com/qlerup/thermostat-pro-timeline-sync
- **Without integration**: Data is stored in **LocalStorage** in the browser (per device).

## Build & release
- This repository is a “single‑file plugin” — the distributed file is in the repo root.
- Create a release (e.g. `v0.1.0`) when ready. HACS prefers a published release.
- The `Validate` GitHub Actions workflow runs the HACS validator automatically.

## Example (card type in UI)
Once the resource is loaded, use the card like this:

```yaml
type: custom:thermostat-timeline-card
entities:
  - climate.living_room
```
